#+TITLE: todo items


* TODO Remove title passing cruft  :wiktionary:dictionary:
  Problem is in [[file:english-parser/wiktionary.lisp]]. Basically atm we
  wind up passing around strings with special markup and a whole set of
  functions to encode/decode these strings. Its messy, hackish and
  difficult to extend.

* TODO Explain to ttech how to write test cases
  DEADLINE: <2010-03-31 Wed>
  All that needs to be done is explain the basic syntax of eos and explain
  how to run the tests with a copy of acumen.

  Note we are pending on a server install.

* TODO Seperate punctuation from words :wiktionary:tokenizer:
  Things like =hi?= are causing the POS tagger to miss the word
  hi. Another side effect here is we lose all context information like
  "hey this is a question".

* TODO Figure out wordnet file/data structure :dictionary:
  Wordnet has some really odd file structure. The only good thing about it
  is lines seem to end with =\n= or =~=.
